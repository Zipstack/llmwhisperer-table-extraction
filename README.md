# PDF Table Extraction with LLMWhisperer and Langchain

This repository contains the code for the blog post [PDF Table Extraction and Processing
](https://unstract.com/blog/extract-table-from-pdf/). 

Tables are a very common form of representing dense information in various documents, especially in PDFs. Extracting tables from PDFs is a common task in many data science and machine learning projects. In this blog post, we will show you how to extract tables from PDFs using LLMWhisperer and Langchain.

## Supported operating systems
You should be able to run this on Linux or on a Mac. Windows is not supported.

## Keys you'll need
You'll need keys for OpenAI and [LLMWhisperer](https://unstract.com/llmwhisperer/), which you can get for free. Please read the blog post for more information. Once you have the keys, please add them to the `.env` file in the root of the project.

## Running the code
Clone this repo and change to the `llmwhisperer-table-extraction` directory. We suggest you run the code after you've created a Python virtual environment. You can create a virtual environment by running the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Next, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Now, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, copy the `sample.env` file to `.env`, edit the `.env` file to add your OpenAI and LLMWhisperer keys:

```bash
cp sample.env .env
```

Finally, run the code:
    
```bash
python extract.py <path to the credit card statement PDF or directory with PDFs>
```

As of March 30, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs was $24.7 billion, which the 
Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years. 

Note 9 - Contingencies 
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that 
have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at 
least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, 
concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.
